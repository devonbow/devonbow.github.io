    <h1>Apache Cordova vs. React Native vs. Flutter</h1>

    <h2>Apache Cordova</h2>

    <p>At the beginning of the rise of mobile technology popularity there was a high demand for rewriting web applications into the mobile ones. Cordova, using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, is fast for developers to pick up, allowing getting small mobile apps almost in no time.
        <br>
        <br>
        To achieve cross-platform development, Cordova provides native wrappers for app components, and uses a HTML Rendering Engine - WebView. Core plugins enable access to all hardware functionality. It’s possible to use third-party plugins or create the new ones whenever necessary.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Free and open source</li>
        <li>Easy learning curve due to being written with well-known HTML5, CSS3 and JS</li>
        <li>Perfect solution for rewriting little JS web apps into the mobile ones</li>
        <li>High speed of mobile app development</li>
        <li>Works well for development of little cross-platform mobile applications like MVP or PoC</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>It’s a hybrid framework unable to provide fully native experience</li>
        <li>WebView slows down app’s performance, which is more noticeable in larger applications with multiple features</li>
        <li>Comparatively tiny community, which means that you may not get the required app development support</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>React Native</h2>

    <p>RN was developed by Facebook as an extension of React.js. It uses components to build mobile applications both for iOS and Android. It is possible to work with native modules, and to create your own ones.
        <br>
        <br>
        React Native reaches native modules through JavaScript bridges, which once used to be a source of performance bottlenecks when it came to animation. In the latter RN release this issue was eliminated as animation runs with a native code without necessary passing of every frame through the JS bridge.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Free and open source </li>
        <li>Provides native feel and high-quality user experience</li>
        <li>Easy learning curve, especially for those familiar with React: it’s written with JS, and has explicit documentation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Some libraries are not supported any more, but you can easily find their more recent alternatives or build your own components</li>
        <li>A few components right out of the box. However, there are plenty of open-source components developed by the community, 3rd-party tools support, and possibility of custom component development</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Flutter</h2>

    <p>Flutter is a cross-platform app development framework created by Google. It offers a wide variety of widgets to build the application with. Flutter uses Dart programming language, which is relatively easy to pick up if you are familiar with JavaScript, Java or C++.
        <br>
        <br>
        The main difference with React Native consists in Dart programming language, otherwise these two platforms are pretty much equally performant.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Free and open source</li>
        <li>A complete set of tools for app development</li>
        <li>Dart directly compiles into native code without any auxiliary tools</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Challenging learning curve: you have to learn Dart and get acquainted with numerous widgets. However, once you do it, the productivity of development will steadily increase</li>
        <li>Dart is a platform-specific language, which means that there is smaller pool of developers to provide app support</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>The last releases of React Native and Flutter provide developers with nearly equal capabilities. The platform choice may depend on the programming language required. While RN uses JavaScript, it may be easier to find a dedicated team for your project. Dart is a less widespread programming language, but its popularity increases.</p>
